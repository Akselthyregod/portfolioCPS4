In presendation layer the priamry difference is the way user input is processed.
The difference is minor and functionally not different.

However the way "dummy" obejcts are addded to the system are slightly different.
Im my solution it is added in the presentation layer, whereas the reference adds it in the domain layer.

My solution is a bit more ready for expansion, whereas the reference is hardcoding 1 of each sensor type in the facade.

The sensor layers are almost identical.
